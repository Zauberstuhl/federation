## [Unreleased]

### Backwards incompatible changes
- Any implementations using the Diaspora protocol and `Post` entities must now use `DiasporaPost` instead. See "Changed" below.

### Added
- Support for using `validate_field()` methods for entity fields and checking missing fields against `_required`. To use this validation, `validate()` must specifically be called for the entity instance.
- Base entities `Comment` and `Reaction` which subclass the new `ParticipationMixin`.
- Diaspora entity `DiasporaComment`, a variant of `Comment`.
- Diaspora entity `DiasporaLike`, a variant of `Reaction` with the `reaction = "like"` default.

### Changed
- Refactored Diaspora XML generators into the Diaspora entities themselves. This introduces Diaspora versions of the base entities called `DiasporaPost`, `DiasporaComment` and `DiasporaLike`. **Any implementations using the Diaspora protocol and `Post` entities must now use `DiasporaPost` instead.**

### Fixes
- Entities which don't specifically get passed a `created_at` now get correct current time in `created_at` instead of always having the time part as `00:00`.
