# Social-Federation

Python library to abstract social federation protocols. Currently supports a subset of the Diaspora protocol with full support intended, and additional protocols after that.

## Introduction

The aim of Social-Federation is to provide and abstract multiple social web protocols like Diaspora in one package. This way applications can be built to (almost) transparently support many protocols without the app builder having to know everything about those protocols.

## Usage and development

Please check [documentation](http://social-federation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
